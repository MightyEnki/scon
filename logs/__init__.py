"""
    Library dedicated to Star Conflict Logs.
    
    Development plan:
        - Make Combat Log parse completely.
        - Make Game Log parse to get information like the local nickname or other needed infos.
        - Create a soft emulation, which keeps track of the basic game outcome / events.
        
    Additional Goals:
        - probably save games in own format to keep space.
        - database entries for kills, encountered players, etc.
